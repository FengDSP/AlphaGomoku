    "1. One-hot embedding is very important. Using a single integer to represent the board state took 10,000 steps for the loss to go down to 1.0. Using one-hot embedding took only 200 steps.\n",
    "2. The model performed poorly in the later game as observed from the interactive plays. It started to ignore the 4-in-a-rows from the player's play. In the beginning, the model played well by following the greedy rule. It's not clear why the model performed poorly in the later game. It might be because the training data has a high coverage of the early games because all early games are short so they are similar. The later games are more diverse so the model might not have enough training data to learn. Another reason might be that the padding doesn't work well, and later game often happens near the border.\n",
    "3. The model doesn't know where to put the first stone when it moves first. This is because the empty board state is not in the training data. We intentionally left the empty board as OOD, so that we can check if RL can get this fixed."

    "## Findings from Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "1. For the first try, a reward is given for the win and a penalty is given for the loss. The draw games were dropped, which caused a problem. One explanation is that the policy quickly learned to avoid losses by playing defensively. During the following self-playing, the defensive policy played against another defensive policy, which caused a very high draw game ratio and no win/lose games for the policy to continue to learn.\n",
    "2. After adding a small penalty(-0.01) to both players for the draw games, the RL algorithm works pretty well. A model trained from one of the RL training runs has reached a 50% win rate against the rule based policy.\n",
    "3. RL training successfully fixed the issue of the first move. The model now knows to always put the first stone in the center.\n",
    "4. However, the RL training is not very stable. Only one of the many training runs achieved comparable performance as the rule-based player. Other runs have some improvement in the middle but not in the end. Only comparing with a single rule-based player is a biased evaluation, but that's the only available evaluation method for now.\n",
    "5. Tried smaller learning rate, cosine / exponential learning rate decay, smaller / larger batch sizes. Still not be able to steadily converging to the high performance model.\n",
    "6. Need to add some analysis if time allows, such as plotting out the activation and gradient distribution changes on each steps. After identifying the reasons of instability, things to try can be prioritized including adding norms, dropout, full connected layers, l2 regularizations, residuals, and etc. Another direction is to make the RL more efficient, by exploring MCTS, actor-critic or other more advanced RL algorithms.\n",
    "7. Given a model is already trained with quality on par with the rule based model, I think the model capacity is good enough."

    "## Further findings with regards to the stability:\n",
    "1. Tried removed split reward by number of stones. Got another good model by luck. Stability is still an issue.\n",
    "2. Introduced a base model as opponent in self-play as the Alpha-Go setup. The policy plays with a fixed base model which is a snapshot of itself. The backprop only goes to the policy model that is on one side of each play as opposed to both sides in the case where the opponent is also the policy itself. In theory, this process is expected to be more stable since the model only get updated when it's better than itself. However, in practice the finding is that the target policy might be updated to a stage where it always becomes worse after each step, so that the base model never gets updated."
